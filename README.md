# Quarter Quartet


## Project Synopsis
We decided to build an Android scavenger hunt specifically for stanford dorms to be used by dorm staff and students. Many dorms tend to host scavenger hunts for students but often struggle with the logistics of such event. This app would assist in the creation and managment of scavenger hunts!
